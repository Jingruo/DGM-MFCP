# DGM-MFCP
We construct a deep neural network to train the algorithm called Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). 
The DGM is used to solve high dimensional PDE coming from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in Mean Field Control Problem (MFCP).
Run the python code to reproduce the results. [ArXiv link: ]
